# Algorithms

This repository serves as a collection of code examples and projects developed while learning 
Princeton's [Algorithms Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1),
[Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) and Stanford's [Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms#courses). The `/src` directory contains code snippets, exercises, and
projects completed as part of the learning process.
